    # === SECURITY VULNERABILITIES ===
    #

    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: rsa - Marvin Attack timing sidechannel
    # Status: NO FIX AVAILABLE
    # Impact: Low - Transitive dependency from sqlx-mysql (dev-dependency only)
    # The vulnerability requires local timing measurements which is not applicable
    "RUSTSEC-2023-0071",

    # RUSTSEC-2024-0363: sqlx - Binary Protocol Misinterpretation  
    # Status: Fix requires sqlx >= 0.8.1, but latest stable is 0.7.4
    # Impact: Low - sqlx is only a dev-dependency used for examples
    # Action: Will upgrade when 0.8.x becomes stable
    "RUSTSEC-2024-0363",

    # RUSTSEC-2024-0437: protobuf - Crash due to uncontrolled recursion
    # Status: Fix requires protobuf >= 3.7.2, but opentelemetry-prometheus 0.15 uses 2.x
    # Impact: Medium - Requires malicious protobuf input to trigger
    # Action: Will address when upgrading opentelemetry ecosystem to 0.31.x
