# Auto-Commit After Work Completion

## Rule

The agent MUST commit changes after completing any task that modifies files.

## When to Commit

Commit after:
- Implementing a feature
- Fixing a bug
- Refactoring code
- Adding or updating documentation
- Creating new files
- Modifying configuration
- Any other file changes

## How to Commit

1. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
2. Write a descriptive commit message following conventional commits
3. Commit the changes: `git commit -m "..."`
4. Push to the current branch if appropriate

## Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `style`: Code style/formatting changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements

### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth2 provider support"
git commit -m "fix(cache): resolve Redis connection timeout"
git commit -m "docs: update SESSION_GUIDE.md with examples"
git commit -m "refactor(core): simplify error handling"
```

## Do NOT Commit When

- Changes are incomplete or broken
- Tests are failing
- The user explicitly asks not to commit
- Only exploring or reading files (no modifications)

## Push Policy

- Push to the current branch after committing unless:
  - The user asks not to push
  - There are merge conflicts
  - The branch is protected and requires PR
