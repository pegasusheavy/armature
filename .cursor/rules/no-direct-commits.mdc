# No Direct Commits to Main and Develop

**CRITICAL RULE:** Never commit directly to `main` or `develop` branches.

## Protected Branches

### `main` branch
- ❌ **NO direct commits**
- ❌ **NO force pushes**
- ✅ Only merge via Pull Requests from `release/*` or `hotfix/*`

### `develop` branch
- ❌ **NO direct commits**
- ❌ **NO force pushes**
- ✅ Only merge via Pull Requests from `feature/*`, `release/*`, or `hotfix/*`

## Why This Rule Exists

1. **Code Review:** All changes must be reviewed before merging
2. **CI/CD:** Automated tests must pass before integration
3. **Quality Control:** Prevents untested code from reaching protected branches
4. **Audit Trail:** Maintains clear history of what changed and why
5. **Team Collaboration:** Ensures visibility of all changes
6. **Rollback Safety:** Makes it easier to revert problematic changes

## Correct Workflow

### For New Features

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Never do this!
git checkout develop
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin develop  # This will be rejected!

# ✅ CORRECT
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/123-new-feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin feature/123-new-feature
# Then create Pull Request on GitHub/GitLab
```

### For Bug Fixes

```bash
# ❌ WRONG
git checkout develop
git commit -am "fix bug"
git push origin develop  # This will be rejected!

# ✅ CORRECT
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/456-fix-bug
git commit -am "fix: resolve issue with authentication"
git push origin feature/456-fix-bug
# Then create Pull Request
```

### For Hotfixes

```bash
# ❌ WRONG
git checkout main
git commit -am "urgent fix"
git push origin main  # This will be rejected!

# ✅ CORRECT
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/1.0.1-critical-fix
git commit -am "fix: resolve critical security issue"
git push origin hotfix/1.0.1-critical-fix
# Then create Pull Request to main AND develop
```

## What If I Accidentally Commit?

### Before Pushing

If you committed to `main` or `develop` locally but haven't pushed yet:

```bash
# Move the commit to a new branch
git branch feature/my-changes
git reset --hard origin/develop  # or origin/main
git checkout feature/my-changes
git push origin feature/my-changes
# Now create Pull Request
```

### After Pushing (If Allowed)

If you somehow managed to push directly:

```bash
# Immediately notify the team
# Revert the commit
git checkout develop  # or main
git revert HEAD
git push origin develop  # or main

# Then create proper feature branch with the fix
git checkout -b feature/proper-implementation
# Re-apply your changes properly
git push origin feature/proper-implementation
# Create Pull Request
```

## Emergency Exceptions

In **extremely rare** emergency situations (production down, data loss, security breach), a direct commit *might* be necessary:

### Emergency Procedure

1. **Get approval** from team lead/CTO
2. **Document reason** in commit message
3. **Notify team** immediately in Slack/Discord
4. **Create follow-up PR** with proper testing
5. **Post-mortem** document after resolution

```bash
# Only in extreme emergency with approval
git checkout main
git commit -am "EMERGENCY: fix critical production outage

Reason: Database connection pool exhausted causing 100% error rate
Approved by: [Name]
Impact: 10,000+ users affected
Ticket: #CRITICAL-123"
git push origin main

# Immediately after, create proper PR for review
git checkout -b hotfix/emergency-followup
# Add tests, documentation, etc.
git push origin hotfix/emergency-followup
```

## Pull Request Requirements

All merges to `main` and `develop` must go through Pull Requests with:

### Required Checks

- ✅ At least one approval from code owner
- ✅ All CI tests passing (`cargo test --all-features`)
- ✅ No clippy warnings (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- ✅ Code is formatted (`cargo fmt -- --check`)
- ✅ No merge conflicts
- ✅ Branch is up to date with target
- ✅ All conversations resolved

### PR Must Include

- Clear description of changes
- Link to related issue/ticket
- Test coverage for new code
- Documentation updates (if needed)
- CHANGELOG update (for releases)

## Branch Protection Setup

### GitHub Settings

```yaml
# .github/branch-protection.yml (conceptual)
branches:
  main:
    protection:
      required_pull_request_reviews:
        required_approving_review_count: 1
        dismiss_stale_reviews: true
      required_status_checks:
        strict: true
        contexts:
          - "test"
          - "lint"
          - "format-check"
      enforce_admins: true
      restrictions: null

  develop:
    protection:
      required_pull_request_reviews:
        required_approving_review_count: 1
      required_status_checks:
        strict: true
        contexts:
          - "test"
          - "lint"
      enforce_admins: true
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: "Just a quick fix"

```bash
# NO! Even small changes need PR
git checkout develop
git commit -am "fix typo"  # Still wrong!
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: "Nobody will notice"

```bash
# Everyone will notice, and CI should block it
git push origin main  # Protected branch!
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: "I'm the only developer"

```bash
# Still wrong - maintains good habits and audit trail
git commit --allow-empty -m "update"
git push origin develop  # Bad practice!
```

### ❌ Mistake 4: Force pushing to fix

```bash
# NEVER force push to protected branches
git push --force origin main  # Extremely bad!
```

## Enforcement

### Git Hooks

Add a pre-push hook to prevent accidents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push

protected_branches='main develop'
current_branch=$(git symbolic-ref HEAD | sed -e 's,.*/\(.*\),\1,')

for branch in $protected_branches; do
    if [ $branch = $current_branch ]; then
        echo "🚫 Direct push to $current_branch is not allowed!"
        echo "   Create a feature branch and use a Pull Request."
        echo "   Run: git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name"
        exit 1
    fi
done

exit 0
```

### Make it executable

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```

## Team Communication

If you see someone attempting to push directly to `main` or `develop`:

### Gentle Reminder

> Hey! I noticed you're trying to commit directly to [main/develop].
> Let's create a feature branch instead so we can get it reviewed:
>
> ```
> git checkout -b feature/your-change
> git push origin feature/your-change
> ```
>
> Then create a PR and I'll review it! 👍

## Summary

### The Golden Rules

1. ✅ **Always** create a feature/hotfix branch
2. ✅ **Always** push to your branch
3. ✅ **Always** create a Pull Request
4. ✅ **Always** wait for review and approval
5. ✅ **Always** ensure CI passes

### Never Do This

1. ❌ **Never** `git checkout main` and commit
2. ❌ **Never** `git checkout develop` and commit
3. ❌ **Never** force push to protected branches
4. ❌ **Never** bypass CI checks
5. ❌ **Never** merge without approval

### Quick Reference

```bash
# The right way every time:
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# Make changes...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
git push origin feature/my-feature
# Create PR on GitHub
```

**Remember:** If it feels like you're taking a shortcut, you probably are.
Use branches and PRs - it's worth the extra 30 seconds! 🚀
