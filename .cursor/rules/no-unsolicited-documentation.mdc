# No Unsolicited Documentation or Summaries

## Rule

**DO NOT** generate summaries, markdown documentation, or other documentation files unless the user explicitly requests them.

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't create unsolicited summaries:**
- Task summaries
- Implementation summaries
- Session summaries
- Progress reports
- Markdown recap documents

❌ **Don't create unsolicited documentation:**
- README files (unless explicitly requested)
- CHANGELOG updates (unless explicitly requested)
- Implementation guides
- Status reports
- Progress documentation

❌ **Don't add verbose explanations:**
- Long explanations of what was done
- Detailed breakdowns of changes
- Extensive commit message formatting in responses

## What TO Do

✅ **Only provide:**
- Direct answers to questions
- Implementation of requested features
- Error fixes and corrections
- Brief confirmations of completed work

✅ **Create documentation when:**
- User explicitly asks: "create a README", "document this", "write a guide"
- Project documentation standards require it (see `documentation.mdc`)
- Feature documentation is required by workspace rules

✅ **Keep responses concise:**
- Focus on the task at hand
- Provide essential information only
- Let the work speak for itself

## Examples

### ❌ Bad (Unsolicited Summary)

```
I've completed the task. Here's what I did:

## Summary
- Created 5 new files
- Modified 3 existing files
- Added comprehensive documentation

## Files Changed
1. file1.rs - Added feature X
2. file2.rs - Fixed bug Y
...
(extensive breakdown)
```

### ✅ Good (Concise Confirmation)

```
Task complete. Created the authentication module with JWT support.
```

### ❌ Bad (Creating Unsolicited Docs)

```
Let me also create a SUMMARY.md to document what we've done...
```

### ✅ Good (Only When Asked)

```
User: "Create a summary of the authentication features"
Assistant: (creates SUMMARY.md)
```

## Exception: Required Documentation

The **only exception** is when documentation is required by workspace rules:

1. **Feature documentation** - As per `documentation.mdc`, every feature MUST have documentation in `docs/`
2. **API documentation** - Inline Rust doc comments (`///`) are required
3. **Examples** - Working examples are required for new features

These are NOT optional and should be created automatically with new features.

## Summary

**Key Principle:** Only generate what is explicitly requested or required by project standards. Don't create summaries, recaps, or extra documentation files unless asked.
